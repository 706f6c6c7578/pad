# pad[Message Padding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography))A small utility allowing users to pad their messages to a fixed size, which they may always use, to make it harder for Eve to guess the content length of a given message.Usage: **pad -p 4096 < infile > outfile**, to unpad: **pad -u < infile > outfile**.
